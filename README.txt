Started to write get /calendar/:title/ request where :title is the title of event you want to see the weather for (get /calendar gives you a list of all event's you've Posted).

I need to think about this a bit more. I'll get to work on it tomorrow morning.

I think it might be a good idea to have a Weather object that has temperature, precipitation,etc methods. That way we could pull them in easily to the get weather request.

My updated stuff is git pushed.
